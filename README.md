# I'm sharing with you what I've learned and coded at the JOY SYSTEMS company. 
The basic programs are written in C# and automate what goes into and updates the SQL server. 
First, iQor_inbound_T and iQor_System programs automatically enter the excel file into the SQL server, and the corresponding SQL queries are executed, and the data is automatically inserted and updated. 
Secondly, iQor_inbound_T insert and iQor_Systems are very useful programs for third parties who are not programmers who can search, insert, and update contents directly to the sql server using the program.
Third, MACAddress - The difference between manual and auto versions is that the manual version allows you to scrape the data from the sql server and add the address part directly for each serial number. The auto version helps you set the time by turning on the scheduler and perform it automatically. 

I hope this is a useful resource for those who are working as a junior prgrammer like me.
